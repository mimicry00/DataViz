The forest barely lives and this only due to a reserve that the Totobiegosode people achieved in a legal manner. They call Chaidi this place which means ancestral land or the place where we always lived and it is part of the \"Ayoreo Totobiegosode Natural and Cultural Heritage\". Before this, they had to live through the traumatic situation of leaving the territory behind and surviving a war. It is the story of the Ayoreo Totobiegosode people, told from the point of view of Asoja, a bird-god with the ability to bring an omniscient- temporal gaze, who becomes the narrator of this story developed in a crossing between documentary and fiction.",

The self-esteem and the possibility of communication with the outside world of persons with disability in a tight-knit environment, under the gaze of prejudice gained from encountering music that changed their lives. Rather than focusing on the difficulties of life for people with disabilities, the film narrows the gap between the disabled and non-disabled communities and focuses on the growth of both disabled and non-disabled people through musical exchanges. Music is a great bridge that connects two worlds, and the process of understanding each other's world through art in different physical situations is sometimes solemn and sometimes beautiful.",

Often criticized as pseudoscience, the Rorschach is still used and remains controversial. The test is often referred to as Ro-sha (short for Rorschach) in Korea. The film Rosha tells stories spoken by a girl named Rosha. It is a photogram of the ten inkblot images on B&W 16mm film. The images overlap and break apart, leaving impressions on the film surface. When the film is projected, the printed inkblots turn into Rosha's glossolalia,* which lies between language and non-language.",

Told first-hand via freewheeling monologues, Portrait of Kaye is a bittersweet portrait of a woman forming her own unique identity while navigating the conflicting influences of her mother’s bawdy humour and her father’s anxieties. Now 74 and recently widowed, her infatuation with a younger neighbour gives her an opportunity to explore personal and sexual freedoms that have always been hidden away. Shot over two years, former next-door neighbour and music video director Ben Reed has assembled a unique and touching meditation on family, film and the meaning of freedom.",

Gathered from the internet, most of the images that compose the film are fragile, amateur-shot traces from within nature and its tremors that regularly rock these communities. Volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and tsunamis form the film’s visual fabric, and are set against images of grandiose natural landscapes. A visual elegy, the film resolutely acknowledges the superiority of nature, with its unrelenting force, capable of transcending all human ambition. With this, the filmmaker seems to remind us that humankind will not emerge victorious from the ecological havoc that it has created.",

    "overview": "A Flower in the Mouth is a film diptych about time running out and how to live through the days that remain. The first act, filmed as an observational documentary in the world’s largest flower market, follows millions of bouquets transiting through a cavernous refrigerated hangar to be sold at auction, an industrial process at once both beautiful and terrifying. The film transitions to fiction in a second act freely adapted from a Pirandello play. A man with a flower-shaped tumour on his lip accosts a traveller in an all-night café. Their seemingly mundane conversation becomes a metaphysical monologue as the man, feeling death approach, clings to life by scrupulously observing its activity, watching reality in every detail, as if to fill the gap between himself and the rest of the world.",
